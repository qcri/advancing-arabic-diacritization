## Contents

### 1. Wikipedia Diacritized Corpus

* **Size:** \~5 million words
* **Source:** 32,835 Wikipedia articles (dump date 2024-02-20)
* **Description:** Each article is fully diacritized by our best-performing BiLSTM model (with a Word Error Rate of ~3% on WikiNews-2014).
* **Format:** JSONL (one article per line).

### 2. WikiNews Benchmarks

* **WikiNews-2014 (multi-reference):** The original benchmark enhanced with multi-reference annotations and consistency fixes.
* **WikiNews-2024:** A newly curated benchmark (\~10 k words) fully diacritized and multi-reference annotated.

### 3. Scoring Script

* Updated evaluation script that **accounts for multi-reference diacritization**, ensuring accurate WER (Word Error Rate) and DER (Diacritic Error Rate) measurements.
* Backwards-compatible: can still be run in single-reference mode.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qcri/advancing-arabic-diacritization.git
cd advancing-arabic-diacritization
```

## Usage

Evaluate a system output against a benchmark:

```bash
cd evaluation
java EvalDiac.java \
   --ref <PATH_TO_REFERENCE_FILE> \
   --sys <PATH_TO_YOUR_MODEL_OUTPUT>
```

The script reports both **WER** and **DER**, with or without multi-reference mode.
